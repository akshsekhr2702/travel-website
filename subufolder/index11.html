                <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
                <p><H3>Welcome to the iconic Taj Mahal, a breathtaking masterpiece nestled in Agra, India. This ethereal marble mausoleum was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. As I approached the Taj, its majestic white domes and intricate carvings left me speechless. The play of sunlight on its surface throughout the day adds to its enchanting allure. Stepping inside, I was awestruck by the symmetrical beauty and the exquisite marble inlay work. As the sun set, the Taj's marble changed hues, creating a magical sight. Truly, the Taj Mahal is an eternal symbol of love and a must-visit wonder.</H3></p>
